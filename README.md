- 1-1-2022: First contract pending for two static pages.  Awaiting first review meeting scheduled.

- 12-31-2021: Set up empty repo and started to set up project specs in README.md.
  - We kick this project off with two responsive static pages, hand-coded:
  - [Item Detail Page](https://eshop.macsales.com/configure-my-mac/UAPH3JS422XXXXC)
  - [Item Type Landing Page](https://eshop.macsales.com/configure-my-mac/macbook-pro)
  - It is assumed that bootstrap conventions are going to be used.

- Other examples of pages doing the same thing:
  - [Detail page](https://www.macofalltrades.com/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2-4ghz-core-i7-late-2016-silver-mll42ll-a-2-very-good-condition/)
  - [Landing page](https://www.macofalltrades.com/apple-laptops/)

- Two other pages will folow:
    - [Home](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fhoXLHbRS-gPBW5FpKyCBNduUduC-Gnq/view?usp=sharing) This is bare bones to start, with custom header and footer.  SEO IS IMPORTANT!
    - [Device Type Choice Page](https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/Apple_Systems/Used/Macs_and_Tablets)
    - Includes custom 404 error page, where we will use [this](https://codepen.io/shankarcabus/pen/hBbDi)


  - Once the static files are approved, we will use them to [create templates](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).
  - [Selenium testing](https://getpocket.com/read/3514991581) sounds wise.
  - [Pruning css](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss) always sounds wise.
  - We will move to [jekyll](http://henrythemes.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap-theme/)
  - [Jekyll repo dir structure](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
  - Good series of tutorials on [ghub pages and jekyll themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYs1idcGnM&t=0s&ab_channel=BillRaymond)
  - We will move to [i18n](https://forestry.io/blog/creating-a-multilingual-blog-with-jekyll/) â€¢ [emoji flags](https://flagpedia.net/emoji)
  - [Other ui stuff I will play with at the end](https://www.alessioatzeni.com/mac-osx-lion-css3/)
