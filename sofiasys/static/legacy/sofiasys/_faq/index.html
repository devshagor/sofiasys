UniBody vs Aluminum..

Aluminum max out at 4GB RAM.
Unibodies support up to 8GB RAM and they are newer generation.  That is why I like them better.

MacBook Pros....

All of those listed run Mountain Lion (latest OS).

The year would be late-2k9 or early 2010.

The key is to get a system that is fast enough, and ensure enough RAM.

All unibodies support 8GB RAM for an extra $100.

Then if you want to get more speed, you might bump it later with an SSD internal drive.

That is what I am running now and it is fine for heavy users.

You are welcome to give me a call for a chat for a few.  Might make this easier => 718-710-9434

I am interested in buying your Macbook pro.  => i5 or i7?
 
Does it have a Thunderbolt port?  => In both cases, yes.
 
Do you have the original software disc that came with the computer?
=> No, but I can provide latest Mountain Lion Installer for free.
 
What resolution is the screen?
=> I set up some web pages with specs for all units currently in stock....

If you have any questions or feedback about those pages, call me:  718-710-9434

Lowest I can go for i7 is $1150. How about i5 for $1050?
